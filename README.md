Notes: [Math Operators](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JSrOECf5FeozLVAlGu7IDqGoR6bf3mR1?usp=drive_link)

<br></br>
**Objective:**  
Write a Python script that uses exactly four instances of the number `4` and any combination of mathematical operators to create expressions that evaluate to the numbers 1 through 10.

**Instructions:**  
**Step 1: Mathematical Operators**

- You are allowed to use the following Python math operators:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
  - Integer division (`//`)
  - Exponentiation (`**`)
  - Modulus (`%`)
  - Parentheses for grouping

**Step 2: Create Expressions**

1. Write expressions using exactly four instances of the number `4` (and no other numbers) to evaluate to the numbers 0 through 10.
2. Use parentheses as needed to control the order of operations.

**Step 3: Output**

4. Print each expression.
5. Ensure that the printed result shows both the expression and its corresponding evaluation.

**Example**
```
print("Zero is "+str(44-44))
```

And the output should be:
```
Zero is 0.
```
